# 🧬 COVID-19 Clinical Trials Analysis

This project explores global clinical trials related to COVID-19. Using data analysis and visualization techniques, we examine trends in trial activity, treatment types, study locations, and more. The goal is to understand how the research community responded to the pandemic and uncover patterns that may inform future public health strategies.

## 🧪 Project Objectives

1. Analyze clinical trials conducted for COVID-19 treatments and vaccines.
2. Clean and preprocess the dataset for meaningful insights.
3. Visualize key metrics: study types, phases, statuses, sponsors, and countries.
4. Identify global trends in trial efforts during the pandemic.

## 🧹 Data Preparation

- Checked for and confirmed:  
  ✅ No duplicate entries  
  ✅ Minimal missing values  
  ✅ Standardized key columns (e.g., country names, trial phases)

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

- Number of trials per **country** 🌍  
- Distribution of **study types** and **phases** 🧫  
- Most common **interventions** and **conditions studied** 🧾  
- Trial **status overview** (e.g., Recruiting, Completed, Terminated)  
- Top **sponsors and collaborators**

---

## 📈 Visualizations

- Bar charts, pie charts, and timelines were used to convey insights.
- Visualized the **global research intensity** over time.
- Compared vaccine vs. drug-based clinical efforts.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- Source: Public clinical trial registries (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov)
- Fields: Trial ID, Title, Study Type, Status, Phase, Country, Start/End Dates, etc.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🧠 Insights

- The USA, China, and India led in the number of COVID-related trials.
- Majority of trials focused on **treatment** rather than **prevention**.
- A surge of trials began in Q2 2020 following the global outbreak.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Model-based prediction of trial success.
- Interactive maps using Plotly or Folium.
- Time-series analysis of pandemic trial progression.
